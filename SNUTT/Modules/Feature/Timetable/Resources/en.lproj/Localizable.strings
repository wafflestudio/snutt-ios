/*
 Localizable.strings
 This file is used to manage localizable strings for the feature module in English.

 How to use:
 - Add your localized strings here in the format "key" = "value";
 - The key is what you will use in your code, and the value is the translated string.

 Examples:
 "welcome_message" = "Welcome to the app!";
 "error_message" = "An error has occurred. Please try again.";

 Usage in code with Tuist synthesized strings:
 let welcomeMessage = TimetableStrings.welcomeMessage
 let errorMessage = TimetableStrings.errorMessage

 Note:
 - Ensure that each key is unique within this file.
 - Add comments to provide context for translators.
