<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

To get the project up and running, ensure that you have the following files in appropriate path:

- `SNUTT-2022/SNUTT/DebugConfig.xcconfig`
- `SNUTT-2022/SNUTT/ReleaseConfig.xcconfig`
- `SNUTT-2022/SNUTT/GoogleServiceDebugInfo.plist`
- `SNUTT-2022/SNUTT/GoogleServiceReleaseInfo.plist`

You'll need to have *fastlane* installed on your local development machine. See [fastlane installation guide](https://docs.fastlane.tools/) for more information. One of the possible methods could be using *homebrew*:

```sh
brew install fastlane
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/wafflestudio/snutt-ios.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder.
   
   ```sh
   cd SNUTT-2022
   ```

3. Configure necessary certificate and provisioning profile. You can switch between multiple environments, including environment variables and code signing settings, all at once via following commands. ***Note that you must provide a valid passphrase when prompted.***
   
   ```sh
   fastlane certificates_development --env dev
   # or
   fastlane certificates_development --env prod
   # or
   fastlane certificates_distribution --env dev
   # or
   fastlane certificates_distribution --env prod
   ```

4. Now you should be able to run the app on your real iOS devices!

### Deployment

> :warning: Admin privileges for this repository are required in order to push this app to the App Store or TestFlight.

This project is deployed by the tag-based deployment method. Simply create and push tags according to the rules below, and fastlane will take care of the rest.

```
^(testflight|appstore)\/v(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)-(release|debug)\.(\d+)$
```

For instance, a tag named `testflight/v3.0.0-debug.1` will trigger an action that creates a `debug` build of the app, sets the version and build number as `3.0.0` and `1` respectively, and uploads it to TestFlight.

Alternatively, an action scheduled under the tag named `appstore/v3.0.0-release.1` will create a release build and submit it to App Store for review. Note that after the review process is complete, you should manually choose to release the app on [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/).

#### Caveats

- You cannot upload debug builds to App Store. In other words, tag names such as `appstore/v3.0.0-debug.1` will be ignored.
- The build numbers for any specific version should be monotonically increasing **for each build configuration**. For example, `appstore/v3.0.0-release.5` can't precede `testflight/v3.0.0-release.3`.
- To submit a build to App Store, you must [create a new release](https://github.com/wafflestudio/snutt-ios/releases). The release description should be carefully written, because it will go directly into the App Store changelog.

## Roadmap

- [ ] iOS 16 support (Lock Screen Widgets, Live Activities, etc.)
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Apple Watch support

See the [open issues](https://github.com/wafflestudio/snutt-ios/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
